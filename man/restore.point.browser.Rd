\title{Examing a previously stored restore point by invoking the browser.}
\usage{
restore.point.browser(name, was.forced = FALSE,
  message.text = paste("restore point", name, ", press ESC to return."),
  deep.copy = get.restore.point.options()$deep.copy)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{name under which the variables have been stored}

\item{was.forced}{flag whether storage of objects was forced. If FALSE (default) a warning is shown if restore.objects is called and is.storing()==FALSE, since probably no objects have been stored.}

\item{message.text}{initial shown message}

\item{deep.copy}{when storing or restoring tries to make a deep copy of R objects that are by default copied by reference, like environments. Setting deep.copy = FALSE can substantially speed up restore.point, however.}
}
\value{
returns nothing
}
\description{
The function is mainly for internal use by restore.point.
