\title{Checks whether for the installed R version the function env.console is able to correctly parse R expressions that extend over more than a line}
\usage{
can.parse.multi.line()
}
\description{
The current implementation of env.console is quite dirty in so far that it parses an error message of the parse() function to check whether a given R expression is assumed to be continued in the next line. That process may not work in R distributions that have error messages that are not in English. The function can.parse.multi.line() tries to check whether that process works or not
